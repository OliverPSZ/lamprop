The fibers and resin used in this example are taken from M. W. Hyer's
"Stress Analysis of Fiber-Reinforced Materials" pp. 89 & 90. The densities
are estimates.

t: [0/90]s laminate
This is a standard symmetric cross-ply laminate. It has fine extensional
moduli in the fiber directions, but a very low shear modulus.

t: [+45/-45]s laminate
The same laminate, rotated 45 degrees. Now the shear modulus is very high,
but the extensional moduli are very low.

t: quasi isotropic laminate
This is an attempt to make a laminate the has good extensional and shear
moduli. If you add more layers, and make the angles between the layers
smaller, the laminate will exhibit better quasi isotropic properties.
