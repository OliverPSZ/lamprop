.Sh NAME
.Nm lamprop
.Nd This manpage documents the file format used by 
.Nm .
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Pp
The file format is very simple. Functional lines have either 
.Ql f ,
.Ql r ,
.Ql t ,
.Ql m
or
.Ql l
as the first non-whitespace
character. This character must immediately be followed by a colon
.Ql \&: .
All other lines are seen as comments and disregarded.
.Pp
The 
.Ql f:
line contains a definition of a fiber. It must contain the
following values, separated by whitespace:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy E1
Young's modulus in the fiber direction.
.It Sy E2
Young's modulus perpendicular to the fiber direction.
.It Sy v12
Poisson's constant.
.It Sy G12
Shear modulus of the fibe.
.It Sy alpha1
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion in the fiber direction.
.It Sy alpha2
CTE perpendicular to the fiber direction.
.It Sy rho
Density of the fiber.
.It Sy name
Name that identifies the fiber. Every fiber in the input files should have
a unique name.
.El
.Pp
Usually, 
.Sy E1
(and other properties in the fibre length direction) is easily obtained
from a fiber supplier. Properties pertaining to the '2' direction
.Sy E2 ,
.Sy v12 
and
.Sy G12 )
are much harder to
come by, but essential for the calculations. The
.Sy EXAMPLES
section below contains some values that the author uses for different fibers.
.Pp
The 
.Ql r: 
line contains a definition of a resin. It must contain the
following values, separated by whitespace:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy E
Young's modulus of the resin.
.It Sy v
Poisson's constant.
.It Sy alpha
CTE of the resin.
.It Sy rho
Density of the resin.
.It Sy name
Name that identifies the resin. Every resin in the input files should have
a unique name.
.El
.Pp
The 
.Ql t:
line starts a new laminate. It only contains the name which identifies the
laminate. This name must be unique within the current input files.
.Pp
The 
.Ql m:
line chooses a resin for the laminate. It must appear after a
.Ql t:
line, and before the 
.Ql l:
lines. It must contain the following values, separated by whitespace:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy vf
The fiber volume fraction for the laminate.
.It Sy name
The name of the resin used in the laminate. This resin must have been
declared previously with an 
.Sy r:
-line.
.El
.Pp
The 
.Ql l:
line defines a single layer (lamina) in the laminate. It must
be preceded by a 
.Ql t:
 and a 
.Ql m:
-line. It must contain the following values, separated by whitespace:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Sy weight
The weight in grams per square meter of the dry fibers.
.It Sy angle
The angle upwards from the x-axis under which the fibers are oriented.
.It Sy name
The name of the fiber used in this layer. This fiber must have been
declared previously with an 
.Ql f:
line.
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following is a sample input file for 
.Nm .

r: 4620 0.36 41.4e-6 1.1  Hyer's resin

t: [0/90]s laminate
This is a standard symmetric cross-ply laminate. It has fine extensional
moduli in the fiber directions, but a very low shear modulus.
m: 0.5 Hyer's resin
l: 100  0 Hyer's carbon fiber
