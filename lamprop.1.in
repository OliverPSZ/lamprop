.El
.Pp
It reads the composition of the laminates from one or more input files. The
format of these files is documented in 
.Xr lamprop 5 .
.Pp
It then calculates the following values for all the laminates in the input
files:
.Bl -tag -width cte_x -compact
.It thickness
Total thickness of the laminate, in millimeters.
.It Vf
Fiber volume fraction. The fraction of the volume that the fibers
contribute to the laminate. This calculation assumes that there are no
voids in the laminate.
.It Wf
Fiber weight fraction. The fraction that the fibers contribute to the total
weight of the laminate.
.It Weight
The area weight of the laminate, in grams per square meter.
.It Resin consumption
The amount of resin, in grams, needed to make a square meter of laminate.
.It E_x
Young's Modulus in the x-direction, in megapascals.
.It E_y
Young's Modulus in the y-direction, in megapascals.
.It G_xy
Shear Modulus, in megapascals.
.It v_xy and v_yx
Poisson constants.
.It cte_x
Coefficient of Thermal Expansion in the x-direction, in fraction per degree K.
.It cte_y
Coefficient of thermal expansion in the y-direction, in fraction per degree K.
.It ABD and abd
The stiffness and compliance matrices of the laminate.
.El
.Pp
These values are written to the standard output.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -tag -width foo -compact
.It Cannot open: Em filename
The file
.Em filename
could not be opened for reading. This could be e.g because the file doesn't exist
or if the user doesn't have access rights to the file.
.It Laminate 'name' already exists! Skipping.
This error occurs when you try to use the same laminate name more than once
within a run. 
.It Found 'm:' line outside a laminate; Skipping.
An 'm:' line should follow an 'l:' line.
.It Resin 'name' unknown. Skipping.
A resin was used that wasn't previously declared with a 'r:' line. Maybe the
name was misspelled?
.It Found 'l:' line but no previous 't:' line! Skipping.
You have to start a laminatde definition with a 't:' line before you can add
lamina to the laminate.
.It Found 'l:' line but no previous 'm:' line! Skipping.
Similarly, you have to define which matrix is to be used with a lamina before
you create a lamina.
.It Unknown fiber in 'l:' line. Skipping.
A fiber was used that wasn't previously declared with a 'f:' line. Maybe the
name was misspelled?

.Sh HISTORY
This program was written to automate the calculations necessary to obtain the
properties of a fiber reinforced laminate based on the properties of the
fibers and the matrix used. While these calculations are well documented in
the literature (see the references above), they are quite cumbersome to do by
hand.
.Pp
The original version of this program was written in C, since implementing it
in a spreadsheet proved cumbersome, inflexible and even produced incorrect
results. The C version ran up to 1.x. 
.Pp
As an exercise in learning the language, the author ported the program to the
Python programming language. This proved to be a much cleaner, more
maintainable and shorter implementation. At the same time the rather arbitrary
versioning numbers were dropped in favor of the short commit-id from the
.Xr git 1
revision control system.

.Sh BUGS
Some of the calculations depend on the perpendicular modulus of the
fibers. This property is hard to find in product literature for anisotropic
fibers like carbon and aramid. In 
.Xr lamprop 5
some values that the author has gathered are reproduced.
